# Hudson code structure

The implementation is one Cargo workspace with five crates. Domain behavior
belongs in tools and configuration. The loop has its own module and performs no IO.

## Dependencies

```

`hudson-harness` owns the current default state machine. An embedder can supply a
custom `Backend` without replacing runtime enforcement. It receives configuration,
a checkpoint, and an input; it returns the next checkpoint and proposed actions.
It never holds provider clients, credentials, store handles, or tool executors.

`hudson-core` owns authority and effects. It validates the proposed action, commits
operation intent and admission counters, then calls the configured executor
outside the database transaction. Subsequent ticks consume recorded outcomes.
Agent and Tool versions are pinned; mutable policy is checked again at dispatch.

The worker and server share `configured.rs`, so JSON agents, tools, providers,
skills, goals, and subagents have one construction path. The server runs its own
background driver; it does not dispatch to a separate worker process. `ConfiguredTree`
keeps each child executor and routes resume by the run’s pinned Agent version.
Child approval therefore uses that child’s provider and tool bindings, including
after restart. Library
applications can construct `Runtime` directly with custom adapters.

## One task through the code

1. A local API request or worker command supplies input and an optional request key.
2. Core submission pins an Agent version and creates a Run and initial Event.
3. `agent_loop.rs` requests a model call using the advertised tool descriptors.
4. Runtime commits an Operation; dispatch applies limits and invokes the provider.
5. Model tool calls become Operations whose exact arguments are validated and
   authorized. An approval wait returns control without executing the tool.
6. Recorded tool results go back into the same loop. Final output passes through
   configured schema/goal verification; failures become bounded repair feedback.
7. Completion, failure, cancellation, or unresolved effects remain inspectable.

The server keeps inspection/control separate from its blocking model/tool driver.
Database handlers run on blocking workers. Public RunView and OperationView omit
checkpoints, executable requests, and credentials. Local operator inspection also
provides attempt IDs for explicit recovery.

## Current boundaries

PostgreSQL transitions lock and replace a namespace's JSONB document. This is
transactional and simple, but serializes writes and is not a high-throughput layout.
There is no distributed scheduler or automatic lease recovery. Same-store
subagents run synchronously with cooperative join and shared budgets.

Rust functions are trusted code. Sandbox execution fails closed; the separate
Hudson Sandbox integration is unfinished. The HTTP host uses one loopback-only
local identity, not hosted multi-tenant authentication.

See [development](development.md), [recovery](recovery.md),
[evaluation](evaluation.md), and the [implementation audit](implementation-status.md).
The [data model](data-model.md) and [product goals](goals.md) also describe later
capabilities; they are not a claim that every planned field or service is present.
