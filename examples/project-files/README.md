# Opt-in read-only local project tools

This customer-owned Python service connects project listing and reading to Hudson's
existing authenticated HTTP tools. It uses the same `token_env` and `effect: read`
configuration as other customer tools. It does not change Hudson's filesystem
permissions. The project directory must be supplied explicitly; starting Hudson or
its interactive terminal does not automatically expose the current directory.

Requires Python 3.10+ on POSIX (Linux/macOS) with `dir_fd`, `O_NOFOLLOW` and
`O_DIRECTORY`. No Python packages are required.

Choose a trusted project directory containing only data you intend the configured
agent/provider to read. Supply `HUDSON_PROJECT_TOKEN` through your normal secure
environment setup with at least 32 random printable ASCII characters; share this
same value with the service and Hudson worker. Do not paste it into an agent
configuration or command arguments. Then start the service:

```sh
python3 examples/project-files/server.py --root /absolute/path/to/authorized-project
```

In a second terminal with the same token environment and your chosen provider
credentials, run the ordinary configured agent:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p hudson-worker -- \
  --config examples/project-files/agent.json \
  --input-file examples/project-files/task.json
```

The worker command invokes your configured model provider and may incur provider
charges; the verification command below uses only fake local fixtures and no model.
The default tool port is 9002; if changing `--port`, change both HTTP endpoints in
`agent.json`. Provider settings use Hudson's usual configuration. The sample agent
limits model calls to eight; this is a budget cap, not a correctness guarantee.

## Authority and limits

The operator explicitly grants reads beneath one root. Directory descriptors and
no-follow opens reject symlink traversal, including symlinked root ancestors.
Paths must be relative, without empty, `.` or `..` segments (`.` alone lists the
root). Names such as `.git`, `.env*`, `.ssh`, `.aws`, `.config`, `.codex`, `.netrc`,
credential/secret files and key extensions are refused and omitted from listings.
Hard-linked files and nonregular files are refused. Reads require UTF-8 and are
limited to 64 KiB; listings return up to 200 sorted entries and a `truncated` flag.
Directories exceeding 1000 scanned entries are refused; narrow the requested path.
There is no recursive listing, shell command, write or delete operation.

Name exclusions cannot detect credentials inside arbitrarily named source files.
A malicious process with permission to change the project can change directory
contents during a request; selecting a trusted, stable root is the operator's
responsibility. Mounts under that root are part of its granted authority. This is a
trusted host process, **not sandbox isolation**. Do not use it to expose hostile
multi-tenant directories or sensitive home directories. Remote cloud agents need
the separately tested sandbox adapter and a sandbox-scoped capability contract.

The service binds only `127.0.0.1`, requires bearer authentication on every request,
does not log requests or print tokens/root paths, and performs no external network
calls. Local processes possessing the token can read the granted root. Tool paths
are `/list` and `/read`; both accept exactly `{"path":"relative/path"}`. Read
results contain `content` and `bytes`; listings contain `entries` and `truncated`.
Tool refusals return HTTP 200 with `{"error":"project request refused"}` so the
existing generic adapter records a read result rather than an uncertain transport
outcome. Authentication and routing errors use HTTP 401/404. Like other read tools,
results reflect the file at request time and need not be stable across invocations;
no write receipts or effect replay are introduced.

Run the boundary and actual authenticated loopback HTTP fixtures:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s examples/project-files -v
```

The tests cover traversal/absolute paths, reserved names, symlinked directories and
root, outside hard links, FIFOs, binary/oversized reads, scan/output bounds, missing
or invalid token, authentication, successful reads/listing and generic refusal
responses. Test tokens and secret file contents are synthetic fixtures.
